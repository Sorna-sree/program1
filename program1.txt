Algorithm:
  
              I use python for this program

Step1: store the input in a list. And assign a variable 'count' as 1.
Step2: Create a for loop which starts with 0 upto n.
Step3: Then create an if condition (a[i]!=" ").
       If it is true then goes to step 4.
Step4: Create a inner loop and it starts with i+1 upto n.
Step5: Create an if condition (a[i]==[j]).
       If it is true then the count will increments and assign " " for a[j].
Step6: After the inner gets stopped, print the count value and assign count as 1.
